Aero is a high-performance web server with strict security limitations and a clean API for web development.

## Goals

The goal of this project is to make web apps developed in Aero reach maximum score in PageSpeed, Observatory and Lighthouse. These goals are objectively measurable.

- [x] Reach 100/100 [Google PageSpeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) score
- [x] Reach 120/100 [Mozilla Observatory](https://observatory.mozilla.org/) score (A+)
- [x] Reach 100/100 [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) score

I already succeeded in getting top scores for all of these checks on one website but I'd still like to lessen the amount of work a developer has to do.

## Documentation

- [API](docs/API.md)
- [Benchmarks](docs/Benchmarks.md)

## Chat

Feel free to join us on [Discord][discord-url] (better than Slack and IRC).

## Work in progress

This is an on-going project. The documentation is lacking and API rework happens regularly to provide a better developer experience. Use at your own risk.
