# Benchmarks

## Routing

Simple routing test on an Intel Core i7-8700 using `Hello World` as output:

```text
Î» wrk -t8 -c400 -d2s http://localhost:4000/
Running 2s test @ http://localhost:4000/

## Conclusion

Considering that it's possible to reach over 300k requests per second on a decent CPU, Aero which is based on `net/http` from the standard library will not be the bottleneck of your website.

Databases and complex application logic are usually the bigger factor in your web application performance.
